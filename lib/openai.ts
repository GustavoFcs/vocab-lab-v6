   - Exclusion: avoid lazy/generic words ("get", "do", "go") unless they are truly the best match.

   - Provide a concise Portuguese translation (include the article if it is a noun, e.g., "a elevação").

${efommInstruction}

When given an English word, perform these steps:
0. MORPHOLOGY (-ing): If the input ends with "-ing", decide whether it is:
   - a VERBAL NOUN (noun) naming an object, system, established activity, or fixed process (e.g., "mooring", "rigging", "wiring"), or
   - a GERUND / PRESENT PARTICIPLE (verb form) expressing an ongoing action.
   Prefer "noun" when the -ing form commonly names an object/system/fixed process, especially in technical or maritime usage.
1. Normalization:
   - If you decided it is a verb form, NORMALIZE to its base form/infinitive (e.g., "running" → "run") and return it in "normalizedWord".
   - If you decided it is a verbal noun, keep it as-is in "normalizedWord" and treat the primary part of speech as "noun".
2. Its primary part of speech in American English.
3. Portuguese translation (Brazilian Portuguese). Provide exactly 1 or 2 most common and accurate translations in Portuguese, separated by slashes.
   - Prefer a neutral, standard translation (no slang, no overly informal phrasing).
   - IMPORTANT (articles): If the part of speech is "noun", include the most natural Portuguese article with the translation when it improves clarity (e.g., "a proa", "o porto", "a âncora"). Use "o/a" for singular and "os/as" for plural when appropriate.
   - IMPORTANT (avoid meta-definitions): Do NOT translate nouns as explanations like "o ato de ..." / "a ação de ..." / "o processo de ..." unless the noun's primary meaning in American English truly is that action/process AND there is no more natural noun translation. Prefer concise noun translations (e.g., for the noun "drink" prefer "a bebida" rather than "o ato de beber").
   - Avoid overly specific/contextual translations unless it's the primary meaning (e.g., do NOT default to "encontro romântico" for "date"; only include it if the primary meaning is clearly romantic date in American English for the given part of speech).
   - If two translations would be near-synonyms or essentially the same meaning (e.g., "beber / tomar" for "drink"), choose ONLY the most natural/pleasant one and return a single translation.
   - Example for "Fabric": "tecido / pano" (only if both are truly distinct/common).
${usageNoteInstruction}
${synonymsInstruction}
5. An natural example sentence in American English.
${conjugationsInstruction}
7. FALSE COGNATE DETECTION (ULTRA-STRICT): 
   - You must check EVERY word (noun, verb, adverb, adjective, etc.) to see if it is a false cognate (falso amigo) for Portuguese speakers.
   - A word is a false cognate if its spelling or sound resembles a Portuguese word, but its meaning in American English is different.
   - EXAMPLES TO DETECT: "Actually" (looks like atualmente), "Parents" (looks like parentes), "Library" (looks like livraria), "Push" (looks like puxe), "Novel" (looks like novela), "Fabric" (looks like fábrica), "Attend" (looks like atender), "Pretend" (looks like pretender), "Notice" (looks like notícia), etc.
   - If it IS a false cognate, set "isFalseCognate" to true and provide a mandatory warning following this pattern: "Word: Significado Correto (não é 'Palavra Errada' - que seria 'Tradução da Errada')".
   - If NOT a false cognate, set "isFalseCognate" to false and "warning" to "".
