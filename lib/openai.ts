${efommInstruction}

When given an English word, perform these steps:
0. MORPHOLOGY (-ing): If the input ends with "-ing", decide whether it is:
   - a VERBAL NOUN (noun) naming an object, system, established activity, or fixed process (e.g., "mooring", "rigging", "wiring"), or
   - a GERUND / PRESENT PARTICIPLE (verb form) expressing an ongoing action.
   Prefer "noun" when the -ing form commonly names an object/system/fixed process, especially in technical or maritime usage.
1. Normalization:
   - If you decided it is a verb form, NORMALIZE to its base form/infinitive (e.g., "running" → "run") and return it in "normalizedWord".
   - If you decided it is a verbal noun, keep it as-is in "normalizedWord" and treat the primary part of speech as "noun".
2. Its primary part of speech in American English.
3. Portuguese translation (Brazilian Portuguese). Provide exactly 1 or 2 most common and accurate translations in Portuguese, separated by slashes.
   - Prefer a neutral, standard translation (no slang, no overly informal phrasing).
   - IMPORTANT (articles): If the part of speech is "noun", include the most natural Portuguese article with the translation when it improves clarity (e.g., "a proa", "o porto", "a âncora"). Use "o/a" for singular and "os/as" for plural when appropriate.
   - IMPORTANT (avoid meta-definitions): Do NOT translate nouns as explanations like "o ato de ..." / "a ação de ..." / "o processo de ..." unless the noun's primary meaning in American English truly is that action/process AND there is no more natural noun translation. Prefer concise noun translations (e.g., for the noun "drink" prefer "a bebida" rather than "o ato de beber").
   - Avoid overly specific/contextual translations unless it's the primary meaning (e.g., do NOT default to "encontro romântico" for "date"; only include it if the primary meaning is clearly romantic date in American English for the given part of speech).
   - If two translations would be near-synonyms or essentially the same meaning (e.g., "beber / tomar" for "drink"), choose ONLY the most natural/pleasant one and return a single translation.
   - Example for "Fabric": "tecido / pano" (only if both are truly distinct/common).

You will receive:
- an English word
- a fixed part of speech
- a NEW Portuguese translation chosen by the user

Your task:
- Keep the same English word and the same part of speech.
- Make all the other fields consistent with the new translation/sense.

Rules:
- Translation must be returned exactly as provided by the user (trimmed).
- For nouns, prefer using an article in Portuguese when helpful ("a proa", "o porto", etc.).
- Avoid meta-definitions like "o ato de..." for nouns unless that is truly the primary meaning and no natural noun translation exists.
- Synonyms/antonyms MUST include a type: "literal" | "figurative" | "slang".
  * literal: physical/direct denotation
  * figurative: metaphor/metaphorical/abstract sense
  * slang: very informal/idiomatic
- Fidelity: Only list synonyms/antonyms that fit this exact sense. Avoid lazy generic words unless truly best match.
